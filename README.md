### Assumptions

I'm assuming you already have julia installed...

This is mainly because the install script is written in Julia.

You don't have to install Julia to get this Vim config, but... it's just a little less automated.

You should definitley get Julia. If not for this repo, then for Julia itself... it's *Super Cool*

### Installation

``` shell
curl -L  https://goo.gl/T6E5gl | julia 
```
